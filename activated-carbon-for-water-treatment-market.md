<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Activated Carbon for Water Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Particles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Activated carbon is widely used in water treatment due to its exceptional adsorption properties, helping to remove impurities and contaminants. The market is primarily categorized into two types: powdered activated carbon (PAC) and granular activated carbon (GAC). PAC is composed of fine particles, allowing for quick adsorption and is often used in batch processes. In contrast, GAC consists of larger granules, providing a longer service life and is more suitable for continuous-flow systems, making both types essential for effective water purification.</p></p>

<p><h1>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Market Size, Market Trends, and Growth Outlook forecasted for period from 2025 to 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) refers to a security testing methodology that evaluates applications for vulnerabilities while they are running. Unlike static testing, which analyzes code at rest, DAST simulates external attacks on applications, helping identify weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious entities. It is particularly effective for identifying runtime vulnerabilities such as authentication, session management, and input validation issues.</p><p>The DAST market is witnessing significant growth due to increasing cybersecurity threats and the escalating need for businesses to safeguard their applications. As organizations increasingly adopt agile development methodologies and DevOps practices, there is a rising demand for security solutions that integrate seamlessly into these workflows. Furthermore, regulatory frameworks and compliance requirements are pushing organizations to prioritize application security.</p><p>Emerging trends in the DAST market include the integration with CI/CD pipelines, the adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning for more accurate detection, and a shift towards cloud-based testing solutions. The Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% during the forecast period, reflecting the growing awareness of application security and the need for proactive risk management strategies.</p></p>

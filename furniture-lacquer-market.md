<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Furniture Lacquer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The furniture lacquer market is primarily divided into solvent-based and water-based types. Solvent-based lacquers contain organic solvents, offering durability, faster drying times, and a robust finish, making them ideal for high-traffic areas. However, they emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), raising environmental and health concerns. Water-based lacquers, on the other hand, are more environmentally friendly, with lower VOC levels and easier cleanup. They dry slower but provide a milder finish, making them suitable for residential applications and safer for indoor use.</p></p>

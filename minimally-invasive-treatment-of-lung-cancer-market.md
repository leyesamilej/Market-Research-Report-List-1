<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Minimally Invasive Treatment of Lung Cancer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lung Tumor Ablation</li><li>Lung Tumor Embolization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The minimally invasive treatment of lung cancer includes techniques such as lung tumor ablation and lung tumor embolization. Lung tumor ablation involves the destruction of tumor cells using heat, cold, or chemicals, allowing for targeted removal while preserving surrounding tissue. In contrast, lung tumor embolization targets the blood supply of the tumor by injecting materials to block blood flow, leading to tumor necrosis. Both methods aim to improve patient outcomes while minimizing recovery time and hospital stays.</p></p>

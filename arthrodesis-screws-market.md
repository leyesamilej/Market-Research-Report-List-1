<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arthrodesis Screws Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Absorbable Screws</li><li>Absorbable Screws</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The arthrodesis screws market is divided into two main types: non-absorbable screws and absorbable screws. Non-absorbable screws are made from materials like titanium or stainless steel, providing long-term stability for fusion surgeries but requiring subsequent removal in some cases. Absorbable screws, made from materials that naturally dissolve in the body, offer the advantage of reducing the need for a second surgery, promoting healing over time without remaining hardware. Both types cater to specific clinical needs and patient preferences.</p></p>
